# GDP Comparison

The project can be viewed [here](https://intense-hollows-69913.herokuapp.com/).

An app to visualize the GDPs of different countries over the years

The first view allows the user to look at the GDPs grouped according to continent, in the form of a histogram and a tree map.
The second view provides a search bar with autocomplete, in which we can type as many countries as we want, and it will show us the GDPs for those countries over the years (2000-2016) in graph form.

This app was built with React, Redux and D3plus.
